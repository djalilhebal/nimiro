## Generate graph
Generate a graph of words (probably a weighted directed acyclic graph)

## Search graph
Using the LM and topics dictionary, find the best sequences (probably using the BEAM search algorithm)

* To consider:
  - Constrained Shortest Path First
  - Iterative deepening depth-first search
  - "Lexically Constrained Decoding for Sequence Generation Using Grid Beam Search"
